### 1. Project Overview 

* Motivation: With the rampant increase of  COVID-19  antigen rapid tests, health departments are unable to track the  virus within our jurisdiction. By analyzing wastewater samples, we can identify how prevalent the virus is within the community and stop the propagation of the virus. Detected cases of COVID-19 is associated with increased levels of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, meaning that data from wastewater analysis can be used as an indicator of the level of transmission of COVID-19.

* Objective: To partner with Community Based Organizations to  support the public. This data can provide an early warning of COVID-19's spread in communities.


### 2. Hypothesis

 " An increase in SARS-CoV-2 that is detected in wastewater means that there are higher levels of COVID-19 within the public" 

### 3. Data Overview 
- The dataset represents how much SARS-CoV-2 virus levels have either increased or decreased, over time at wastewater sites across the United States. Communities can track the presence of the virus, which causes COVID-19, in wastewater samples. This data can provide an early warning of COVID-19's spread in communities
 

### 4. Data Limitations 
* The data only represents the sites who participated in the watershed collection of samples.Â 
* The collection only began on 2021 and is collected in 15 day intervals.
* The values differentiate whether there is a change from the last 15 days

### 5. Procedures
- Script from Jupyter Notebook where the following commands were conducted 
* Cleaned and merged raw data 
* Created Categorical plots
* Conducted exploratory analysis
* Geographic visualiazations using Folium
* Machine Learning - Supervised Linear regression
* Machine Learning - Unsupervised - Clustering
* Sourcing and analysis time series data
* Tableau dashboard
