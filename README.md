### National Wastewater Surveillance

### Project Overview 

The dataset represents how much SARS-CoV-2 virus levels have either increased or decreased, over time at wastewater sites across the United States. Communities can track the presence of the virus, which causes COVID-19, in wastewater samples. This data can provide an early warning of COVID-19's spread in communities


### Motivation
With the rampant increase of  COVID-19  antigen rapid tests, health departments are unable to track the  virus within our jurisdiction. By analyzing wastewater samples, we can identify how prevalent the virus is within the community and stop the propagation of the virus. Detected cases of COVID-19 is associated with increased levels of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, meaning that data from wastewater analysis can be used as an indicator of the level of transmission of COVID-19.


### Insight 
We can partner with Community Based Organizations to  support the community. This data can provide an early warning of COVID-19's spread in communities
